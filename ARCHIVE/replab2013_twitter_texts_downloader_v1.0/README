=========================================================================


The TwitterTextsDownloader is a Java program that allows downloading the 
texts of tweets using HTML requests. 



1.- How to use:

The tool needs a Java JRE 1.5 or higher installed in 
the operating system (available at http://www.java.com/download). To run the tool execute: 

	java â€“Xmx3000m -jar TwitterTextsDownloader.jar inputOption 
		inputFile outputOption outputFile [--delay]
		
The -Xmx java parameter is indicated beacause the tool is a potential memory 
consumer when the number of tweets is big.
		
Valid options are: 

	--help 				Shows the help menu with information about the different options. 
	--input-folder 		Reads all the files in the input folder and download 
						the text of each tweet writing the output in the given output
						parameter. With this option only --output-folder is allowed. 
						The input format should be the RepLab 2013 tweets_info format. 
	--input-file 		Reads the specified file and download the text of each tweet 
						writing the output in the given output parameter (file/folder). The input format 
						should be the RepLab 2013 tweets_info format. 
	--output-folder		The folder to write the downloaded texts. 
	--output-file 		The file to write the downloaded texts. 
	--delay 			The delay in milliseconds between html requests. Default is 3000.
	
The tool includes the resume option at file level. The toool downloads around 500
tweet in 25 minutes with default delay.
